# Project Labyrinth

This week's assignment was to practice pair programming and to build a maze game using Redux and API.

## The problem

We approached to problem by looking at the recorded videos from the the lessons and tried to codealong. However, we had a hard time understanding how we would use / understand the recorded material that Maks built and translate it into our project. We got stuck in figureing out how to write the fetch. So we reached out for help from our team, looked at pre written code by former technigo students and even got help over zoom from a previus student. But we were still stuk so we boked a one-on-one with Maks. He helped us get all the functionalities in place. After that we styled our site.

If we hade more time we would have put some more effort in to the styling.
